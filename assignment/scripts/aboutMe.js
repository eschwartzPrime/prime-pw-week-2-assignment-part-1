// REQUIRED FEATURES:
// 1 - Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it the value of your first name
let firstName = 'Edan';

// 2 - Create a second variable called `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name
let lastName = 'Schwartz';



// 3 - Create a third variable called `fullName`, assign it the value of your first and last name
// (remember, you already have variables for this, can you use those?)

//let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;  // string concatenation

// Template String or Template Literal
let fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;  // variable interpolation

console.log('fullName is', fullName);

let direction = 'south';
let city = 'Minneapolis';

console.log(`
    Hello everyone,
    My name is ${firstName} ${lastName}

    I grew up in the ${direction} side of ${city}
`);

// 4 - Console log the value of `fullName`

// 5 - Create a variable called `luckyNumber` and assign it the value of your lucky number.

// 6 - Console log this sentence, adding in the variables you created above: 
// 'My name is (full name), and I think (lucky number) is a winner!'.
// Refer back to the videos if you need help with this one.

// 7 - Create a variable named `adventurous` and set it to a boolean value (true or false)

// 8 - Create a variable named `food`, and set its value to a string of your favorite food

// 9 - Create a variable called `pets` and set it to the value of the number of pets you have

// 10 - Create a variable called `friendsPets` and assign it the value of the number of pets your friend has

// 11 - Add two pets to your `pets` variable

// 12 - Create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice

// 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!", 
// if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"


// 14 - Create a compound conditional: if luckyNumber is 2 and adventurous is true,
// console log "Roll the dice!"

let luckyNumber = 14;   // Number
let adventurous = true; // Boolean

console.log('14 + 2', luckyNumber + 2);     /// 16


if (luckyNumber = 14) {
    console.log('Your lucky number is 14');
}


// 15 - Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!" 
//if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`,
// console logs "I have enough pets" if the value of `pets` is equal to the value of `allowedPets`,
// and console logs "Oh no, I have too many pets!"
// if the value of `pets` is greater than the value of `allowedPets`.

// STRETCH GOALS:

// 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
// correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
// assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
// be sure to think through all the scenarios. 
// console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.

// 17 - Rewrite question 16 with a `switch` statement. You'll need to do research!

// 18 -- Rewrite question 13 with a `ternary` operator. You'll need to do research!
